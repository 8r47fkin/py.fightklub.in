        <h1>While Loop</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			The next control flow statement we are going to look at is the while
loop. Like the name suggests, a while loop repeatedly executes
instructions inside the loop while a certain condition remains valid. The
structure of a while statement is as follows:
		</p>
        <code>
            while condition is true:
            do A
        </code>
        <p>
            Most of the time when using a while loop, we need to first declare a
variable to function as a loop counter. Let’s just call this variable
counter. The condition in the while statement will evaluate the value
of counter to determine if it smaller (or greater) than a certain value. If it
is, the loop will be executed. Let’s look at a sample program.
        </p>
        <code>
            counter = 5

            while counter > 0:
                print (“Counter = “, counter) counter = counter -1

            If you run the program, you’ll get the following output
            Counter = 5
            Counter = 4
            Counter = 3
            Counter = 2
            Counter = 1
        </code>
        <p>
            At first look, a while statement seems to have the simplest syntax and
should be the easiest to use. However, one has to be careful when using
while loops due to the danger of infinite loops. Notice that in the
program above, we have the line counter = counter - 1? This line
is crucial. It decreases the value of counter by 1 and assigns this new 
value back to counter, overwriting the original value.
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to decrease the value of counter by 1 so that the loop
condition while counter > 0 will eventually evaluate to False. If we
forget to do that, the loop will keep running endlessly resulting in an
infinite loop. If you want to experience this first hand, just delete the line
counter = counter - 1 and try running the program again. The
program will keep printing counter = 5 until you somehow kill the
program. Not a pleasant experience especially if you have a large
program and you have no idea which code segment is causing the infinite
loop.
