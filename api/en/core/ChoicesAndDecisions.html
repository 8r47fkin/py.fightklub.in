			Congratulations, you’ve made it to the most interesting section. I hope
you’ve enjoyed python so far. In this chapter, we’ll look at how to
make your program smarter, capable of making choices and decisions.
Specifically, we’ll be looking at the if statement, for loop and while
loop. These are known as control flow tools; they control the flow of the
program. In addition, we’ll also look at the try, except statement that
determines what the program should do when an error occurs.

        <p>
            However, before we go into these control flow tools, we have to first look
at condition statements.
