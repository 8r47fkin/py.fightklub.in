        <h1>If Statement</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			The if statement is one of the most commonly used control flow
statements. It allows the program to evaluate if a certain condition is met,
and to perform the appropriate action based on the result of the
evaluation. The structure of an if statement is as follows:
		</p>
        <code>
            if condition 1 is met: do A
            elif condition 2 is met: do B
            elif condition 3 is met: do C
            elif condition 4 is met: do D
            else:
            do E
        </code>
        <p>
            elif stands for “else if” and you can have as many elif statements as
you like.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’ve coded in other languages like C or Java before, you may be
surprised to notice that no parentheses ( ) are needed in Python after the
if, elif and else keyword. In addition, Python does not use curly { }
brackets to define the start and end of the if statement. Rather, Python
uses indentation. Anything indented is treated as a block of code that will
be executed if the condition evaluates to true.
        </p>
        <p>
            To fully understand how the if statement works, fire up IDLE and key in
the following code.
        </p>
        <code>
            userInput = input('Enter 1 or 2: ')
            if userInput == "1": print ("Hello World") 
            print (“How are you?”) 
            elif userInput == "2": print ("Python Rocks!") 
            print (“I love Python”) 
            else: print ("You did not enter a valid number")
        </code>
        <p>
            The program first prompts the user for an input using the input function.
The result is stored in the userInput variable as a string.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next the statement if userInput == "1": compares the
userInput variable with the string “1”. If the value stored in userInput
is “1”, the program will execute all statements that are indented until the
indentation ends. In this example, it’ll print “Hello World”, followed by
“How are you?”.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, if the value stored in userInput is “2”, the program will
print “Python Rocks”, followed by “I love Python”.
        </p>
        <p>
            For all other values, the program will print “You did not enter a
valid number”.
        </p>
        <p>
            Run the program three times, enter 1, 2 and 3 respectively for each run.
You’ll get the following output:
        </p>
        <code>
            Enter 1 or 2: 1
            Hello World
            How are you?
        </code>
        <code>
            Enter 1 or 2: 2
            Python Rocks!
            I love Python
        </code>
        <code>
            Enter 1 or 2: 3
            You did not enter a valid number
        </code>
