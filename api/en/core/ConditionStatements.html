        <h1>Condition Statements</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			All control flow tools involve evaluating a condition statement. The
program will proceed differently depending on whether the condition is
met.
		</p>
        <p>
            The most common condition statement is the comparison statement. If
we want to compare whether two variables are the same, we use the ==
sign (double =). For instance, if you write x == y, you are asking the
program to check if the value of x is equals to the value of y. If they are
equal, the condition is met and the statement will evaluate to True. Else,
the statement will evaluate to False.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other comparison signs include != (not equals), < (smaller than), >
(greater than), <= (smaller than or equals to) and >= (greater than or
equals to). The list below shows how these signs can be used and gives
examples of statements that will evaluate to True.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not equals: 5 != 2
        </p>
        <p>
            Greater than: 5 > 2
        </p>
        <p>
            Smaller than: 2 < 5
        </p>
        <p>
            Greater than or equals to: 5 >= 2 <br> 5 >= 5
        </p>
        <p>
            Smaller than or equals to: 2 <= 5 <br> 2 <= 2
        </p>
        <p>
            We also have three logical operators, and, or, not that are useful if we
want to combine multiple conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The and operator returns True if all conditions are met. Else it will return
False. For instance, the statement 5==5 and 2>1 will return True
since both conditions are True.
        </p>
        <p>
            The or operator returns True if at least one condition is met. Else it will
return False. The statement 5 > 2 or 7 > 10 or 3 == 2 will
return True since the first condition 5>2 is True.
        </p>
        <p>
            The not operator returns True if the condition after the not keyword is
false. Else it will return False. The statement not 2>5 will return True
since 2 is not greater than 5.
        </p>
