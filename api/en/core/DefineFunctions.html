        <h1>Define our own Functions</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			We can define our own functions in Python and reuse them throughout
the program. The syntax for defining a function is as follows:
<code>
        def functionName(parameters): code detailing what the
        function should do return [expression]
</code>
There are two keywords here, def and return.
		</p>
        <p>
            def tells the program that the indented code from the next line onwards
is part of the function. return is the keyword that we use to return an
answer from the function. There can be more than one return
statements in a function. However, once the function executes a return
statement, the function will exit. If your function does not need to return
any value, you can omit the return statement. Alternatively, you can
write return or return None.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let us now define our first function. Suppose we want to determine if a
given number is a prime number. Here’s how we can define the function
using the modulus (%) operator we learned while Operating Operators and the for
loop and if statement we learned in Looping.
        </p>
        <code>
            def checkIfPrime (numberToCheck): for x in range(2,
            numberToCheck): if (numberToCheck%x == 0):
                return False return True
        </code>
        <p>
            In the function above, lines 2 and 3 uses a for loop to divide the given
parameter numberToCheck by all numbers from 2 to numberToCheck
- 1 to determine if the remainder is zero. If the remainder is zero,
numberToCheck is not a prime number. Line 4 will return False and the
function will exit.
        </p>
        <p>
            If by last iteration of the for loop, none of the division gives a remainder
of zero, the function will reach Line 5, and return True. The function will
then exit.
        </p>
        <p>
            To use this function, we type checkIfPrime(13) and assign it to a
variable like this
<code>
    answer = checkIfPrime(13)
</code>
Here we are passing in 13 as the parameter. We can then print the
answer by typing print(answer). We’ll get the output: True.
        </p>
