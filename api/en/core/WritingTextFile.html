        <h1>Writing to a Text File</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			Now that we’ve learned how to open and read a file, let’s try writing to it.
To do that, we’ll use the ‘a’ (append) mode. You can also use the ‘w’
mode, but you’ll erase all previous content in the file if the file already
exists. Try running the following program.
<code>
    f = open (‘myfile.txt’,'a')
    f.write(‘\nThis sentence will be appended.’)
    f.write(‘\nPython is Fun!’)
    f.close()
</code>
		</p>
        <p>
            Here we use the write() function to append the two sentences ‘This
sentence will be appended.’ and ‘Python is Fun!’ to the
file, each starting on a new line since we used the escape characters
‘\n’. You’ll get
<code>

            First rule of fightklub.in is, we talk about fightklub.in

            This sentence will be appended.
            Python is Fun!
</code>
