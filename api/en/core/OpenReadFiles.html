        <h1>Opening and Reading Text Files</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			The first type of file we are going to read from is a simple text file with
multiple lines of text. To do that, let’s first create a text file with the
following lines.
		</p>
        <p>
            <code>
            Welcome to fightklub.in
            First rule of fightklub.in is, we talk about fightklub.in
            second rule of fightklub.in is, let's talk loud about fightklub.in
            http://www.fightklub.in/
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Save this text file as myfile.txt to your desktop. Next, fire up IDLE
and type the code below. Save this code as fileOperation.py to your
desktop too.
        </p>
        <code>
            f = open (‘myfile.txt’,'r')
            firstline = f.readline()
            secondline = f.readline()
            print (firstline)
            print (secondline)

            f.close()
        </code>

        <p>
            The first line in the code opens the file. Before we can read from any file,
we have to open it (just like you need to open any ebook on your kindle
device or app to read it). The open() function does that and requires two
parameters:
        </p>
        <p>
            The first parameter is the path to the file. If you did not save
fileOperation.py and myfile.txt in the same folder (desktop in
this case), you need to replace ‘myfile.txt’ with the actual path
where you stored the text file. For instance, if you stored it in a folder
named ‘PythonFiles’ in your C drive, you have to write
<code>
    ‘C:\\PythonFiles\\myfile.txt’ (with double backslash \\).
</code>
The second parameter is the mode. This specifies how the file will be
used. The commonly used modes are
<code>
    'r' mode:
    For reading only.

    'w' mode:
    For writing only
</code>
If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.
If the specified file exists, any existing data on the file will be erased.
<code>
    'a' mode:
    For appending.
</code>
If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.
If the specified file exist, any data written to the file is automatically added
to the end
<code>
    'r+' mode:
For both reading and writing.
</code>
After opening the file, the next statement firstline =
f.readline() reads the first line in the file and assigns it to the
variable firstline.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each time the readline() function is called, it reads a new line from
the file. In our program, readline() was called twice. Hence the first
two lines will be read. When you run the program, you’ll get the output:
        </p>
        <code>
            Welcome to fightklub.in

            First rule of fightklub.in is, we talk about fightklub.in
        </code>
        <p>
            You’ll notice that a line break is inserted after each line. This is because
        the readline() function adds the ‘\n’ characters to the end of each
        line. If you do not want the extra line between each line of text, you can
        do print(firstline, end = ‘’). This will remove the ‘\n’
        characters. After reading and printing the first two lines, the last sentence
        f.close() closes the file. You should always close the file once you
        finish reading it to free up any system resources.
