        <h1>Variable Scope</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			An important concept to understand when defining a function is the
concept of variable scope. Variables defined inside a function are treated
differently from variables defined outside. There are two main differences.
		</p>
        <p>
            Firstly, any variable declared inside a function is only accessible within
the function. These are known as local variables. Any variable declared
outside a function is known as a global variable and is accessible
anywhere in the program.
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand this, try the code below:
            <code>
                def myFunction():
                    print(“\nINSIDE THE FUNCTION”) #Global variables are accessible inside a function print (message1)
                #Declaring a local variable message2 = “Local Variable”
                    print (message2)

                #Calling the function myFunction()

                print(“\nOUTSIDE THE FUNCTION”)
                #Global variables are accessible outside function
                print (message1)

                #Local variables are NOT accessible outside function.
                print (message2)
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you run the program, you will get the output below.
        </p>
        <code>
            INSIDE THE FUNCTION
            Global Variable
            Local Variable

            OUTSIDE THE FUNCTION
            Global Variable
            NameError: name 'message2' is not defined
        </code>
        <p>
            Within the function, both the local and global variables are accessible.
Outside the function, the local variable message2 is no longer
accessible. We get a NameError when we try to access it outside the
function.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second concept to understand about variable scope is that if a local
variable shares the same name as a global variable, any code inside the
function is accessing the local variable. Any code outside is accessing
the global variable. Try running the code below
        </p>
        <code>
            message1 = "Global Variable (shares same name as a local variable)"

            def myFunction():
                message1 = "Local Variable (shares same name as a global variable)"
                print(“\nINSIDE THE FUNCTION”) print(message1)

            # Calling the function myFunction()

            # Printing message1 OUTSIDE the function print
            (“\nOUTSIDE THE FUNCTION”) print (message1)
        </code>
        <p>
            You’ll get the output as follows:
<code>
    INSIDE THE FUNCTION
    Local Variable (shares same name as a global variable)
    OUTSIDE THE FUNCTION
    Global Variable (shares same name as a local variable)
</code>
When we print message1 inside the function, it prints "Local
Variable (shares same name as a global variable)" as it
is printing the local variable. When we print it outside, it is accessing the
global variable and hence prints "Global Variable (shares same
name as a local variable)".
        </p>
