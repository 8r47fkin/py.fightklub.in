			When working with loops, sometimes you may want to exit the entire loop
when a certain condition is met. To do that, we use the break keyword.
Run the following program to see how it works.
		</p>
        <code>
            j = 0
            for i in range(5): j = j + 2
print (‘i = ’, i,‘, j = ’, j) if j == 6: break
        </code>
        <p>
            You should get the following output.
        </p>
        <code>
            i = 0 , j = 2
            i = 1 , j = 4
            i = 2 , j = 6
        </code>
        <p>
            Without the break keyword, the program should loop from i = 0 to i = 4
because we used the function range(5). However with the break
keyword, the program ends prematurely at i = 2. This is because when i =
2, j reaches the value of 6 and the break keyword causes the loop to
end.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the example above, notice that we used an if statement within a for
loop. It is very common for us to ‘mix-and-match’ various control tools in
programming, such as using a while loop inside an if statement or
using a for loop inside a while loop. This is known as a nested control
statement.
