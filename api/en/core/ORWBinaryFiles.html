        <h1>Opening, Reading and Writing Binary Files</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			Binary files refer to any file that contains non-text, such as image or video
files. To work with binary files, we simply use the ‘rb’ or ‘wb’ mode. Copy
a jpeg file onto your desktop and rename it myimage.jpg. Now edit the
program above by changing the first two line lines
<code>
    inputFile = open (‘myfile.txt’,'r')
    outputFile = open (‘myoutputfile.txt’,'w')

to

inputFile = open (‘myimage.jpg’,'rb')
outputFile = open (‘myoutputimage.jpg’,'wb')
</code>
Make sure you also change the statement outputFile.write(msg +
'\n') back to outputFile.write(msg).
		</p>
        <p>
            Run the new program. You should have an additional image file named
myoutputimage.jpg on your desktop. When you open the image file, it
should look exactly like myimage.jpg.
