			Another useful keyword for loops is the continue keyword. When we
use continue, the rest of the loop after the keyword is skipped for that
iteration. An example will make it clearer.

        <code>
            j = 0
            for i in range(5): j = j + 2
                print (‘\ni = ’, i,‘, j = ’, j) if j == 6:
            continue print (‘I will be skipped over if j=6’)
        </code>
        <p>
            You will get the following output:
        </p>
        <code>
            i = 0 , j = 2
            I will be skipped over if j=6

            i = 1 , j = 4
            I will be skipped over if j=6

            i = 2 , j = 6

            i = 3 , j = 8
            I will be skipped over if j=6

            i = 4 , j = 10
            I will be skipped over if j=6
        </code>
        <p>
            When j = 6, the line after the continue keyword is not printed. Other
than that, everything runs as per normal.
