			Cool! We’ve come to the last section before the project. In
this section, we’ll look at how to work with external files.
		</p>
        <p>
            Previously, we learned how to get input from users using the
input() function. However, in some cases, getting users to enter data
into our program may not be practical, especially if our program needs to
work with large amounts of data. In cases like this, a more convenient
way is to prepare the needed information as an external file and get our
programs to read the information from the file. In this section, we are
going to learn to do that. Ready?
