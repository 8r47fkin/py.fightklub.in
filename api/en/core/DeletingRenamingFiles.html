        <h1>Deleting and Renaming Files</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			Two other useful functions we need to learn when working with files are
the remove() and rename() functions. These functions are available in
the os module and have to be imported before we can use them.
		</p>
        <p>
            The remove() function deletes a file. The syntax is
remove(filename). For instance, to delete myfile.txt, we write
remove(‘myfile.txt’).
        </p>
        <p>
            The rename() function renames a file. The syntax is rename (old
name, new name). To rename oldfile.txt to newfile.txt, we
write rename(‘oldfile.txt’,‘newfile.txt’).
        </p>
