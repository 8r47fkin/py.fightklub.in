        <h1>What are Functions?</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			Functions are simply pre-written codes that perform a certain task. For an
analogy, think of the mathematical functions available in MS Excel. To
add numbers, we can use the sum() function and type sum(A1:A5)
instead of typing A1+A2+A3+A4+A5.
		</p>
        <p>
            Depending on how the function is written, whether it is part of a class (a
class is a concept in object-oriented programming which we will not cover
in this book) and how you import it, we can call a function simply by
typing the name of the function or by using the dot notation. Some
functions require us to pass data in for them to perform their tasks. These
data are known as parameters and we pass them to the function by
enclosing their values in parenthesis ( ) separated by commas.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, to use the print() function for displaying text on the
screen, we call it by typing print(“Hello World”) where print is
the name of the function and “Hello World” is the parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, to use the replace() function for manipulating text
strings, we have to type “Hello World”.replace(“World”, “Universe”) where replace is the name of the function and “World”
and “Universe” are the parameters. The string before the dot (i.e.
“Hello World”) is the string that will be affected. Hence, “Hello
World” will be changed to “Hello Universe”.
