        <h1>Creating our Own Module</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			Besides importing built-in modules, we can also create our own modules.
This is very useful if you have some functions that you want to reuse in
other programming projects in future.
		</p>
        <p>
            Creating a module is simple. Simply save the file with a .py extension and
put it in the same folder as the Python file that you are going to import it
from.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose you want to use the checkIfPrime() function defined earlier
in another Python script. Here’s how you do it. First save the code above
as prime.py on your desktop. prime.py should have the following
code.
        </p>
        <code>
            def checkIfPrime (numberToCheck):
                for x in range(2, numberToCheck):
                    if (numberToCheck%x == 0):
                        return False
                return True
        </code>
        <p>
            Next, create another Python file and name it useCheckIfPrime.py.
Save it on your desktop as well. useCheckIfPrime.py should have the
following code.
        </p>
        <code>
            import prime
            answer = prime.checkIfPrime(13)
            print (answer)
        </code>
        <p>
            Now run useCheckIfPrime.py. You should get the output True.
Simple as that.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, suppose you want to store prime.py and useCheckIfPrime.py in different folders. You are going to have to add
            some codes to useCheckIfPrime.py to tell the Python interpreter
            where to find the module.            
        </p>
        <p>
            Say you created a folder named ‘MyPythonModules’ in your C drive to
store prime.py. You need to add the following code to the top of your
useCheckIfPrime.py file (before the line import prime).
        </p>
        <code>
            import sys

            if 'C:\\MyPythonModules' not in sys.path:
            sys.path.append('C:\\MyPythonModules')
        </code>
        <p>
            sys.path refers to your Python’s system path. This is the list of
directories that Python goes through to search for modules and files. The
code above appends the folder ‘C:\MyPythonModules’ to your system
path.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now you can put prime.py in C:\MyPythonModules and
checkIfPrime.py in any other folder of your choice.
        </p>
