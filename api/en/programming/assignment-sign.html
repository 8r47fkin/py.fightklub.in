		<h1>The Assignment Sign</h1>
        <br>
		<p>
			Note that the = sign in the statement userAge = 0 has a different
meaning from the = sign we learned in Math. In programming, the = sign
is known as an assignment sign. It means we are assigning the value on
the right side of the = sign to the variable on the left. A good way to
understand the statement userAge = 0 is to think of it as userAge <-
0.
		</p>
        <p>
            The statements x = y and y = x have very different meanings in
programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Confused? An example will likely clear this up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Type the following code into your IDLE editor and save it.
        </p>
        <code>
            x = 5
            y = 10
            x = y
            print ("x = ", x)
            print ("y = ", y)
        </code>
        <p>
            Now run the program. You should get this output:
        </p>
        <code>
            x = 10
            y = 10
        </code>
        <p>
            Although x has an initial value of 5 (declared on the first line), the third
line x = y assigns the value of y to x (x <- y), hence changing the
value of x to 10 while the value of y remains unchanged
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, modify the program by changing ONLY ONE statement: Change the third line from x = y to y = x. Mathematically, x = y and y = x mean
            the same thing. However, this is not so in programming.            
        </p>
        <p>
            Run the second program. You will now get
        </p>
        <code>
            x = 5
            y = 5
        </code>
        <p>
            You can see that in this example, the x value remains as 5, but the value
of y is changed to 5. This is because the statement y = x assigns the
value of x to y (y <- x). y becomes 5 while x remains unchanged as 5.
        </p>
