			In the example above, we used the input() function twice to get our
user’s name and age.
		</p>
        <code>
            myName = input("Please enter your name: ")
        </code>
        <p>
            The string “Please enter your name: ” is the prompt that will be displayed
on the screen to give instructions to the user. After the user enters the
relevant information, this information is stored as a string in the variable
myName. The next input statement prompts the user for his age and
stores the information as a string in the variable myAge.             
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The input() function differs slightly in Python 2 and Python 3. In Python
2, if you want to accept user input as a string, you have to use the
raw_input() function instead.
