        <h1>Naming a Variable</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			A variable name in Python can only contain letters (a - z, A - B), numbers
or underscores (_). However, the first character cannot be a number.
Hence, you can name your variables userName, user_name or
userName2 but not 2userName.
		</p>
        <p>
            In addition, there are some reserved words that you cannot use as a
variable name because they already have preassigned meanings in
Python. These reserved words include words like print, input, if,
while etc. We’ll learn about each of them in subsequent sections.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, variable names are case sensitive. username is not the same as
userName.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two conventions when naming a variable in Python. We can
either use the camel case notation or use underscores. Camel case is
the practice of writing compound words with mixed casing (e.g.
thisIsAVariableName). This is the convention that we’ll be using in
the rest of the sections. Alternatively, another common practice is to use
underscores (_) to separate the words. If you prefer, you can name your
variables like this: <i>this_is_a_variable_name</i>.
        </p>
        <code>
            userAge = 0
        </code>
        <p>
            After you define the variable userAge, your program will allocate a
certain area of your computer's storage space to store this data. You can
then access and modify this data by referring to it by its name, userAge.
Every time you declare a new variable, you need to give it an initial value.
In this example, we gave it the value 0. We can always change this value
in our program later.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also define multiple variables at one go. To do that simply write
        </p>
        <code>
            userAge, userName = 33, ‘Bharath’
        </code>
        <p>
            This is equivalent to
        </p>
        <code>
            userAge = 33
            userName = ‘Bharath’
        </code>
