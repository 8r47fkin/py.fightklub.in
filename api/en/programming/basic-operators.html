        <h1>Basic Operators</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			Besides assigning a variable an initial value, we can also perform the
usual mathematical operations on variables. Basic operators in Python
include +, -, , , /, % and * which represent addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, floor division, modulus and exponent respectively.
		</p>
        <p>
            Example:
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose x = 5, y = 2
        </p>
        <p>
            Addition: x + y = 7
        </p>
        <p>
            Subtraction: x - y = 3
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiplication: x*y = 10
        </p>
        <p>
            Division: x/y = 2.5
        </p>
        <p>
            Floor Division: x//y = 2 (rounds down the answer to the nearest whole number)
        </p>
        <p>
            Modulus: x%y = 1 (gives the remainder when 5 is divided by 2)
        </p>
        <p>
            Exponent: x**y = 25 (5 to the power of 2)
        </p>
