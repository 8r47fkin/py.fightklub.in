        <h1>[name]</h1>

			List refers to a collection of data which are normally related. Instead of
storing these data as separate variables, we can store them as a list. For
instance, suppose our program needs to store the age of 5 users. Instead
of storing them as user1Age, user2Age, user3Age, user4Age and
user5Age, it makes more sense to store them as a list.
		</p>
        <p>
            To declare a list, you write listName = [initial values]. Note
that we use square brackets [ ] when declaring a list. Multiple values are
separated by a comma.
        </p>
        <i>
            Example:
        </i>
        <code>
            userAge = [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
        </code>
        
        <p>
            We can also declare a list without assigning any initial values to it. We
simply write listName = []. What we have now is an empty list with
no items in it. We have to use the append() method mentioned below to
add items to the list.
        </p>

        <p>
            Individual values in the list are accessible by their indexes, and indexes
always start from ZERO, not 1. This is a common practice in almost all
programming languages, such as C and Java. Hence the first value has
an index of 0, the next has an index of 1 and so forth. For instance,
userAge[0] = 21, userAge[1] = 22
        </p>

        <p>
            Alternatively, you can access the values of a list from the back. The last
item in the list has an index of -1, the second last has an index of -2 and
so forth. Hence, userAge[-1] = 25, userAge[-2] = 24.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can assign a list, or part of it, to a variable. If you write userAge2 =
userAge, the variable userAge2 becomes [21, 22, 23, 24, 25].
        </p>
        <p>
            If you write userAge3 = userAge[2:4], you are assigning items with
index 2 to index 4-1 from the list userAge to the list userAge3. In other
words, userAge3 = [23, 24].
        </p>
        <p>
            The notation 2:4 is known as a slice. Whenever we use the slice notation
in Python, the item at the start index is always included, but <u>the item at
the end is always excluded.</u> Hence the notation 2:4 refers to items from
index 2 to index 4-1 (i.e. index 3), which is why userAge3 = [23, 24]
and not [23, 24, 25].
        </p>
        <p>
            The slice notation includes a third number known as the stepper. If we
write userAge4 = userAge[1:5:2], we will get a sub list consisting
of every second number from index 1 to index 5-1 because the stepper is
2. Hence, userAge4 = [22, 24].
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, slice notations have useful defaults. The default for the first
number is zero, and the default for the second number is size of the list
being sliced. For instance, userAge[ :4] gives you values from index
0 to index 4-1 while userAge[1: ] gives you values from index 1 to
index 5-1 (since the size of userAge is 5, i.e. userAge has 5 items).
        </p>
        <p>
            To modify items in a list, we write listName[index of item to be
modified] = new value. For instance, if you want to modify the
second item, you write userAge[1] = 5. Your list becomes userAge
= [21, 5, 23, 24, 25]
        </p>
        <p>
            To add items, you use the append() function. For instance, if you write
userAge.append(99), you add the value 99 to the end of the list. Your
list is now userAge = [21, 5, 23, 24, 25, 99]
        </p>
        <p>
            To remove items, you write del listName[index of item to be
deleted]. For instance, if you write del userAge[2], your list now
becomes userAge = [21, 5, 24, 25, 99] (the third item is
deleted)
        </p>
        <p>
            To fully appreciate the workings of a list, try running the following
program.
        </p>
        <code>
            #declaring the list, list elements can be of different
            data types myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, “Hello”]
        </code>
        <code>
            #print the entire list.
            print(myList)
            #You’ll get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
            “Hello”]
        </code>
        <code>
            #print the third item (recall: Index starts from zero).
            print(myList[2])
            #You’ll get 3
        </code>
        <code>
            #print the last item.
            print(myList[-1])
            #You’ll get “Hello”
        </code>
        <code>
            #assign myList (from index 1 to 4) to myList2 and
            print myList2
            myList2 = myList[1:5]
            print (myList2)
            #You’ll get [2, 3, 4, 5]
        </code>
        <code>
            #modify the second item in myList and print the
            updated list myList[1] = 20
            print(myList)
            #You’ll get [1, 20, 3, 4, 5, 'Hello']
        </code>
        <code>
            #append a new item to myList and print the updated
            list myList.append(“How are you”)
            print(myList)
            #You’ll get [1, 20, 3, 4, 5,
            'Hello', 'How are you']
        </code>
        <code>
            #remove the sixth item from myList and print the updated list del
            myList[5]
            print(myList)
            #You’ll get [1, 20, 3, 4, 5, 'How are you']
        </code>
        <p>
            There are a couple more things that you can do with a list. For sample codes and more examples on working with a list, refer to Appendix B.
