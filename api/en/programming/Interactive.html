        <h1>Making Your Program Interactive</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			Now that we’ve covered the basics of variables, let us write a program
that makes use of them. We’ll revisit the “Hello World” program we wrote
at Start, but this time we’ll make it interactive. Instead of just saying
hello to the world, we want the world to know our names and ages too. In
order to do that, our program needs to be able to prompt us for
information and display them on the screen.
		</p>
        <p>
            Two built-in functions can do that for us: input() and print().               
        </p>
        
        <p>
            For now, let’s type the following program in IDLE. Save it and run it.
        </p>

        <p>
            <code>
                myName = input("Please enter your name: ")
                myAge = input("What about your age: ")
            </code>
            <code>
                print ("Hello World, my name is", myName, "and I am", myAge, "years old.")
            </code>
            <i>
                The program should prompt you for your name.
            </i>
            <code>
                Please enter your name:
            </code>
            <p>
                Supposed you entered Bharath. Now press Enter and it’ll prompt you for
your age.
            </p>
            <code>
                What about your age:
            </code>
            <p>
                Say you keyed in 33. Now press Enter again. You should get the
following statement:
            </p>
            <code>
                Hello World, my name is Bharath and I am 33 years old.
            </code>
        </p>
