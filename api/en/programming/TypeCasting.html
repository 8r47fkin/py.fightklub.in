        <h1>Type Casting In Python</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			Sometimes in our program, it is necessary for us to convert from one
data type to another, such as from an integer to a string. This is known as
type casting.
		</p>
        <p>
            There are three built-in functions in Python that allow us to do type
casting. These are the int(), float(), and str() functions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The int() function in Python takes in a float or an appropriate string and
converts it to an integer. To change a float to an integer, we can type
int(5.712987). We’ll get 5 as the result (anything after the decimal
point is removed). To change a string to an integer, we can type int
(“4”) and we’ll get 4. However, we cannot type int (“Hello”) or
int (“4.22321”). We’ll get an error in both cases.
        </p>

        <p>
            The float() function takes in an integer or an appropriate string and
changes it to a float. For instance, if we type float(2) or float(“2”),
we’ll get 2.0. If we type float(“2.09109”), we’ll get 2.09109 which is
a float and not a string since the quotation marks are removed.
        </p>

        <p>
            The str() function on the other hand converts an integer or a float to a
string. For instance, if we type str(2.1), we’ll get “2.1”.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we’ve covered the three basic data types in Python and their
casting, let’s move on to the more advanced data types.
