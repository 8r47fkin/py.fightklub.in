			Dictionary is a collection of related data PAIRS. For instance, if we want
to store the username and age of 5 users, we can store them in a
dictionary.
		</p>
        <p>
            To declare a dictionary, you write dictionaryName = {dictionary
                key : data}, with the requirement that dictionary keys must be unique
                (within one dictionary). That is, you cannot declare a dictionary like this
                myDictionary = {“Bharath”:33, “Kumar”:66, “Bharath”:13}.                
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This is because “Bharath” is used as the dictionary key twice. Note that we
use curly brackets { } when declaring a dictionary. Multiple pairs are
separated by a comma.
        </p>
        <i>
            Example: 
        </i>
        <code>
            userNameAndAge = {
                “Bharath”:33,
                “Kumar”:66,
                “Cdart”:13,
                “Cdart”:“Not Available”
            }
                
        </code>
        <p>
            You can also declare a dictionary using the dict( ) method. To declare
the userNameAndAge dictionary above, you write
        </p>
        <code>
            userNameAndAge = dict(Bharath = 33, Kumar = 66, Aadhi = 13, Cdart = “Not Available”)
        </code>
        <p>
            When you use this method to declare a dictionary, you use round
brackets ( ) instead of curly brackets { } and you do not put quotation
marks for the dictionary keys.
        </p>
        <p>
            To access individual items in the dictionary, we use the dictionary key,
which is the first value in the {dictionary key : data} pair. For
instance, to get Kumar’s age, you write userNameAndAge[“Kumar”].
        </p>
        <p>
            You’ll get the value 66.
        </p>
        <p>
            To modify items in a dictionary, we write
            dictionaryName[dictionary key of item to be modified]
            = new data. For instance, to modify the “Kumar”:66 pair, we write
            userNameAndAge[“Kumar”] = 68. Our dictionary now becomes
            <code>
            userNameAndAge = {
                “Bharath”:33,
                “Kumar”:68,
                “Aadhi”:13,
                “Cdart”:“Not Available”
            }
        </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also declare a dictionary without assigning any initial values to it.
We simply write dictionaryName = { }. What we have now is an
empty dictionary with no items in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add items to a dictionary, we write dictionaryName[dictionary
key] = data. For instance, if we want to add “Valarmathi”:63 to our
dictionary, we write userNameAndAge[“Joe”] = 40. Our dictionary
now becomes 
<code>
        userNameAndAge = {
            “Bharath”:33,
            “Kumar”:68,
            “Aadhi”:13,
            “Cdart”:“Not Available”,
            “Valarmathi”:60
        }
</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            To remove items from a dictionary, we write del
dictionaryName[dictionary key]. For instance, to remove the
“Alex”:13 pair, we write del userNameAndAge[“Alex”]. Our
dictionary now becomes 
<code>
    userNameAndAge = {
        “Peter”:38,
        “John”:21,
        “Alvin”:“Not Available”,
        “Joe”:40}
</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Run the following program to see all these in action.
        </p>
        <code>
            #declaring the dictionary, dictionary keys and data
can be of different data types
myDict = {“One”:1.35, 2.5:”Two Point Five”, 3:”+”, 7.9:2}
        </code>
        <code>
            #print the entire dictionary
            print(myDict)
            #You’ll get {2.5: 'Two Point Five' , 3: '+','One':1.35, 7.9: 2}
            #Note that items in a dictionary are not stored in the same order as the way you declare them.
        </code>
        <code>
            #print the item with key = “One”.
            print(myDict[“One”])
            #You’ll get 1.35
        </code>
        <code>
            #print the item with key = 7.9.
            print(myDict[7.9])
            #You’ll get 2
        </code>
        <code>
            #modify the item with key = 2.5 and print the updated dictionary
            myDict[2.5] = “Two and a Half”
            print(myDict)
            #You’ll get {2.5: 'Two and a Half' , 3: '+', 'One': 1.35, 7.9: 2}
        </code>
        <code>
            #add a new item and print the updated dictionary
            myDict[“New item”] = “I’m new”
            print(myDict)
            #You’ll get {'New item': 'I’m new', 2.5: 'Two and a Half', 3: '+', 'One': 1.35, 7.9: 2}
        </code>
        <code>
            #remove the item with key = “One” and print the updated dictionary del myDict[“One”]
            print(myDict)
            #You’ll get {'New item': 'I’m new' , 2.5: 'Two and a Half', 3: '+', 7.9: 2}
        </code>
