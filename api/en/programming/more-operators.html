        <h1>More Assignment Operators</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			Besides the = sign, there are a few more assignment operators in Python
(and most programming languages). These include operators like +=, -=
and *=
		</p>
        <p>
            Suppose we have the variable x, with an initial value of 10. If we want to
increment x by 2, we can write
x = x + 2
        </p>
        <p>
            The program will first evaluate the expression on the right (x + 2) and
assign the answer to the left. So eventually the statement above
becomes x <- 12.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of writing x = x + 2, we can also write x += 2 to express the
same meaning. The += sign is actually a shorthand that combines the
assignment sign with the addition operator. Hence, x += 2 simply
means x = x + 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, if we want to do a subtraction, we can write x = x - 2 or x -
= 2. The same works for all the 7 operators mentioned in the section
above.
