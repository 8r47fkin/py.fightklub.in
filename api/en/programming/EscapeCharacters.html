        <h1>Escape Characters</h1>
		
        <br>
		<p>
			Sometimes we may need to print some special “unprintable” characters
such as a tab or a newline. In this case, you need to use the \ (backslash)
character to escape characters that otherwise have a different meaning.
		</p>
        <p>
            For instance to print a tab, we type the backslash character before the
letter t, like this: \t. Without the \ character, the letter t will be printed. With
it, a tab is printed. Hence, if you type print (‘Hello\tWorld’), you’ll
get Hello World
        </p>
        <p>
            Other common uses of the backslash character are shown below.
>>> shows the command and the following lines show the output.
        </p>

        <p><u>\n (Prints a newline)</u></p>
        <code>
            >>> print (‘Hello\nWorld’)
            Hello
            World
        </code>

        <p><u>\\ (Prints the backslash character itself)</u></p>
        <code>
            >>> print (‘\\’)
            \
        </code>
        
        <p><u>\” (Prints double quote, so that the double quote does not signal the end of the string)</u></p>
        <code>
            >>> print (“I am 5'11\" tall”)
            I am 5’11” tall
        </code>

        <p><u>\’ (Print single quote, so that the single quote does not signal the end of the string)</u></p>
        <code>
            >>> print (‘I am 5\’11” tall’)
            I am 5’11” tall
        </code>
        <p>
            If you do not want characters preceded by the \ character to be interpreted as special characters, you can use raw strings by adding an r before the first quote. For instance, if you do not want \t to be interpreted as a tab, you should type print (r‘Hello\tWorld’). You will get Hello\tWorld as the output.
