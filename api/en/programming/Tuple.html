			Tuples are just like lists, but you cannot modify their values. The initial
values are the values that will stay for the rest of the program. An
example where tuples are useful is when your program needs to store
the names of the months of the year.
		</p>
        <p>
            To declare a tuple, you write tupleName = (initial values).
Notice that we use round brackets ( ) when declaring a tuple. Multiple
values are separated by a comma.
        </p>
        <i>
            Example:
        </i>
        <code>
            monthsOfYear = (“Jan”, “Feb”, “Mar”, “Apr”, “May”, “Jun”, “Jul”, “Aug”, “Sep”, “Oct”, “Nov”, “Dec”)
        </code>
        
        <p>
            You access the individual values of a tuple using their indexes, just like
with a list.
        </p>
        <i>
            Hence, 
        </i>
        <code>
            monthsOfYear[0] = “Jan”, monthsOfYear[-1] = “Dec”.
        </code>
        <p>
