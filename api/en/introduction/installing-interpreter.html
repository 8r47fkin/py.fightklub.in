		<h1>Installing interpreter</h1>
        <br>
		<p>
			Before we can write our first Python program, we have to download the
appropriate interpreter for our computers.
		</p>

		<p>
			We’ll be using Python 3 in this manual because as stated on the official
Python site “Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of
the language”. In addition, “Python 3 eliminates many quirks that can
unnecessarily trip up beginning programmers”.
		</p>
        <p>
            However, note that Python 2 is currently still rather widely used. Python 2
and 3 are about 90% similar. Hence if you learn Python 3, you will likely
have no problems understanding codes written in Python 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            To install the interpreter for Python 3, head over to
https://www.python.org/downloads/. The correct version should be
indicated at the top of the webpage. Click on the version for Python 3 and
the software will start downloading.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively if you want to install a different version, scroll down the page
and you’ll see a listing of other versions. Click on the release version that
you want. We’ll be using version 3.4.2 in this book. You’ll be redirected to
the download page for that version.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scroll down towards the end of the page and you’ll see a table listing
various installers for that version. Choose the correct installer for your computer. 
The installer to use depends on two factors:
            <ol>
                <li>The operating system (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux) and</li>
                <li>The processor (32-bit vs 64-bit) that you are using.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, if you are using a 64-bit Windows computer, you will likely
be using the "Windows x86-64 MSI installer". Just click on the link to
download it. If you download and run the wrong installer, no worries. You
will get an error message and the interpreter will not install. Simply
download the correct installer and you are good to go.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have successfully installed the interpreter, you are ready to
start coding in Python.
