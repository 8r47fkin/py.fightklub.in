		<h1>What is Python?</h1>
        <br>
		<p>
			Python is a widely used high-level programming language created by
Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. The language places strong
emphasis on code readability and simplicity, making it possible for
programmers to develop applications rapidly.
		</p>

		<p>
			Like all high level programming languages, Python code resembles the
English language which computers are unable to understand. Codes that
we write in Python have to be interpreted by a special program known as
the Python interpreter, which weâ€™ll have to install before we can code, test
and execute our Python programs. We'll look at how to [link:#api/en/introduction/installing-interpreter install] the Python
interpreter soon.
		</p>
        <p>
            There are also a number of third-party tools, such as Py2exe or
Pyinstaller that allow us to package our Python code into stand-alone
executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems like
Windows and Mac OS. This allows us to distribute our Python programs
without requiring the users to install the Python interpreter.
