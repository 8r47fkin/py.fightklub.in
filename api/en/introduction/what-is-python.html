			Disclaimer: This is an Open Source project in developent! 
			Python for all, where we will start with basic of python then level up to
			Data science, building softwares, games, websites, server, hacking, AI and
			exploring VR/ AR / XR possibilities with python.

			Also this is a course in development, if you feel stuck you can alert us, so we can work on improving it, 
			or even you can build this!
			This page in itself can initiate you to the realm of Programming! (just allow it)

		<h1>Getting Started</h1>

		<p>
			Python is a high-level programming language created by
Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. The language places strong
emphasis on code readability and simplicity, making it possible for
programmers to develop applications rapidly.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/introduction/hll.jpg" alt="levels of languages" width="100%">

		<p>
			Like all high level programming languages, Python code resembles the
English language which computers are unable to understand. Codes that
we write in Python have to be interpreted by a special program known as
the Python interpreter.
		</p>

		<p>
			heard it somewhere the best way to learn any programming language is to code and in this 
			process of learning to code things, I realized they were completely right, 
			So let's fire up our editors and start coding and after the code is live, 
			we can see the theory behind it?
			<code>
				may be clone this project from GitHub and check the exercise, starter folders (for users who are serious)
				there are examples which will be updated frequently, you can git pull frequently to be updated
			</code>

		<p>
			Deal?

		<hr>
		Exercise to get started for advanced users
		<hr>

		<p>
			we can run python with many things, but let's do the programmer way,
			starting with command prompt or terminal or whatever your OS ecosystem wish to call, 
			then we will go to idle, Anaconda, jupyter notebook, google colab, pyCharm, VS code and other 
			environment as the project evolves and has the requirement.
		</p>
		
		<img src="/api/en/introduction/cmd1.gif" alt="learn to code by coding" width="100%">
		<p>
			cmd prompt looks something like this, open it and navigate around the folders may be type
			<code>
				cd..
				cd\
				dir
				cd D:
				cd E:
				dir
				mkdir python-fk
				cd python-fk
				git clone https://github.com/8r47fkin/py.fightklub.in.git
			</code>
			welcome to your first error
			did you install git? browse about git or try <a href="https://git.fightklub.in">git.fightklub.in</a>(another project - in development)
		</p>
		<p>
			Once git is installed and then again you start playing around with your cmd terminal, 
			you would notice the git clone command above would have downloaded you some files, <br>
			can you navigate to that file location and browse around, 
			if possible get overwhelmed <br>
			start digging deeper into it, you have your complete python learning 
			module there (also there is more to it)
		</p>
		<p>
			time to close this website?
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p>
			you can but, 
			thats just the tip of the iceberg!
		</p>
        <p>
            Installing live server, making the program run in your localhost like a temporary website or
			having your playground completely ready will be explored next
        </p>
