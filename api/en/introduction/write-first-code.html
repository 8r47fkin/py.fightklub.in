        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
		<h2>Using the Python Shell, IDLE and Writing our
            FIRST program</h2>
        <br>
		<p>
			We’ll be writing our code using the IDLE program that comes bundled
with our Python interpreter.
		</p>

		<p>
			To do that, let’s first launch the IDLE program. You launch the IDLE
program like how you launch any other programs. For instance on
Windows 8, you can search for it by typing “IDLE” in the search box.
Once it is found, click on IDLE (Python GUI) to launch it. You’ll be
presented with the Python Shell shown below.
		</p>

        <p>
            The Python Shell allows us to use Python in interactive mode. This
means we can enter one command at a time. The Shell waits for a
command from the user, executes it and returns the result of the
execution. After this, the Shell waits for the next command.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try typing the following into the Shell. The lines starting with >>> are the
commands you should type while the lines after the commands show the
results.
        </p>
        <code>
            >>> 2+3
            5
            >>> 3>2
            True
            >>> print (‘Hello World’)
            Hello World
        </code>
        <p>
            When you type 2+3, you are issuing a command to the Shell, asking it to
evaluate the value of 2+3. Hence, the Shell returns the answer 5. When
you type 3>2, you are asking the Shell if 3 is greater than 2. The Shell
replies True. Finally, print is a command asking the Shell to display
the line Hello World.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Python Shell is a very convenient tool for testing Python commands,
especially when we are first getting started with the language. However, if
you exit from the Python Shell and enter it again, all the commands you
type will be gone. In addition, you cannot use the Python Shell to create
an actual program. To code an actual program, you need to write your
code in a text file and save it with a .py extension. This file is known as a
Python script.
        </p>
        <p>
            To create a Python script, click on File > New File in the top menu of our
Python Shell. This will bring up the text editor that we are going to use to
write our very first program, the “Hello World” program. Writing the “Hello
World” program is kind of like the rite of passage for all new
programmers. We’ll be using this program to familiarize ourselves with
the IDLE software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Type the following code into the text editor (not the Shell).
        </p>
        <code>
            #Prints the Words “Hello World”
            print (“Hello World”)
        </code>
        <p>
            You should notice that the line #Prints the Words “Hello World”
is in red while the word “print” is in purple and “Hello World” is in
green. This is the software’s way of making our code easier to read. The
words “print” and “Hello World” serve different purposes in our
program, hence they are displayed using different colors. We’ll go into
more details in later section.
        </p>
        <p>
            The line #Prints the Words “Hello World” (in red) is actually not
part of the program. It is a comment written to make our code more
readable for other programmers. This line is ignored by the Python
interpreter. To add comments to our program, we type a # sign in front of
each line of comment, like this:
        </p>
        <code>
            #This is a comment
            #This is also a comment
            #This is yet another comment
        </code>
        <p>
            Alternatively, we can also use three single quotes (or three double
quotes) for multiline comments, like this:
        </p>
        <code>
            ’’’
This is a comment
This is also a comment
This is yet another comment
’’’
        </code>
        <p>
            Now click File > Save As… to save your code. Make sure you save it with
the .py extension.
        </p>
        <p>
            Done? Voilà! You have just successfully written your first Python
program.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally click on Run > Run Module to execute the program (or press F5).
You should see the words Hello World printed on your Python Shell.
        </p>
