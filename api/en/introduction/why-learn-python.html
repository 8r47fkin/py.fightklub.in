		<h1>Why Learn Python?</h1>
        <br>
		<p>
			There are a large number of high level programming languages available,
such as C, C++, and Java. The good news is all high level programming
languages are very similar to one another. What differs is mainly the
syntax, the libraries available and the way we access those libraries. A
library is simply a collection of resources and pre-written codes that we
can use when we write our programs. If you learn one language well, you
can easily learn a new language in a fraction of the time it took you to
learn the first language.

			If you are new to programming, Python is a great place to start. One of
the key features of Python is its simplicity, making it the ideal language
for beginners to learn. Most programs in Python require considerably
fewer lines of code to perform the same task compared to other
languages such as C. This leads to fewer programming errors and
reduces the development time needed. In addition, Python comes with an
extensive collection of third party resources that extend the capabilities of
the language. As such, Python can be used for a large variety of tasks,
such as for desktop applications, database applications, network
programming, game programming and even mobile development. Last
but not least, Python is a cross platform language, which means that
code written for one operating system, such as Windows, will work well
on Mac OS or Linux without making any changes to the Python code.
